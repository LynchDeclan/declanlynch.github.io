<h1 id="question_1"><strong>What is Elite Dangerous?<strong></h1>

<h2 class="head-font">A Game Knowledge base for beginners</h2>

<hr size="1" noshade>

<p>Elite Dangerous: Horizons (released 2014) is a massive space simulator game created by game developer company Frontier Developments as the fourth game and second season to Elite: Dangerous in the Elite video game series that had started in 1997. It is the most popular and most played game within the Elite Franchise. In the game, the player takes the role of a space pilot, or "CMDR" as referred to colloquially. Upon starting, CMDR's will be able to explore a vast 1:1 scale Milky Way Galaxy, while also being able to participate in various forms of trade and combat to acheive higher rankings in those areas, all throughout open-ended gameplay.</p>

<h1 class="head-font">No Limits</p>

<p class="stylep">Within the galaxy, players will be able to explore up to around 400 billion star systems, each hosting different star classes and bodies, some moons even possible to land on. according to the latest data, around 0.004% of the entire galaxy has been discovered, leaving the vast majority of the galaxy still unmapped and ready to be discovered by players.
Even though there is still much to discover, most, if not all, big game events and economics happen in where most players reside, a little section of the galxy called "The Bubble" where there are a vast majority of starports, outposts, and planetary ports, hosting things such as shipyards, outfitting, engineering workshops, mission boards, passenger lounges, and more (althogh outposts and planetary ports will sometimes not have some of these things). Players are able to dock at starports to trade, obtain ship upgrades and accquire missions.</p>

<img class="center" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/exB4pRUQG8Y/maxresdefault.jpg">

<h1 class="head-font">Currency</h1>

<p class="stylep">In Elite Dangerous: Horizons, as made obvious, there is an in game currency that most players refer to as Credits (or CR by the game). Credits can be used to purchase new ships, modules for ships, fuel (available at all starports), commodities, NPC crew memebers, advanced maintenance things, and many more. CMDR's can have an unlimited amount of credits, but credits can only be made by completing missions, profit from trading commoditites, bounties from blowing up pirates, and exploration data from long expeditions after mapping various star systems. If you feel like you are not making enough, go check out some money making guides on youtube such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVG4EEkk_I4">this one.</a></p>

<h1 class="head-font">Factions and Powerplay</p>
<img class="center" src="https://i.redd.it/2fgcj6lnw6061.jpg">
<p class="stylep">There are three major factions in Elite Dangerous: the Empire, the Federation, and the Alliance. these factions control various systems and starports, each spread across the bubble and beyond. The Powerplay addition (released in patch 1.3) introduced gameplay where players could ally themselves with a faction and complete faction missions that came with faction rewards.</p>

<p class="stylep">Since these factions are so widespread, they are split into many different minor factions allied with them that control different systems and starports for the specific faction so that the leaders only control their home star system. 

<p class="stylep">Apart from Powerplay, players are able to rank up to 14 ranks with both the Empire and the Federation to gain access to special ships and system permits. The Alliance is not here becuase there is no special ranking system for it, their three ships can already be bought without any sort of ranking.</p>

<h1 id="question_2">Basic Mechanics and Gameplay</h1>

<h2 class="head-font">A Small Guide to the Fundametals</h2>

<hr size="1" noshade>

<h1 class="head-font">The Interface<h2>
<img class="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/baK8DPB.jpeg" alt="Labelling the most important parts of the interface! Read carefully!">

<p class="stylep">You'll want to get used to this, since it displays all information and elements in every ship you will ever fly (Read the labels in the image carefully!). Every time you play you will see this and you will learn how to use every single little element that you come across. Although on some occasions there are new elements added such as a new target ship/system/station/body and info on it on the bottom left. There will also be changes to the center of the HUD (the radar) as you are coming in to dock, like a parking assist you see in cars. During the more advanced technique of deep core mining there will be changes to the top-right info panel. Don't worry, you wont have to rememeber things like that right now, at the moment, lets focus on the essentials.</p> 

<h3 class="head-font">Radar/Scanner</h3>
<p class="stylep">in the center of the HUD, like I mentioned before, you will see the Radar/scanner, as labeled in the image above. This is one of the key elements of your ship's interface and you will most likely be using this alot throughout your Elite Journey. The Radar displays nearby ships, planets, and stations.</p>

<img class="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/YzEfvSH.jpeg">

<p class="stylep">As displayed in the image, ships displayed on the radar can vary in appearance, with solid squares and triangles being NPC's with their weapons/hardpoints retracted or deployed, and hollow squares and triangles being actual human players with THEIR weapons/hardpoints retracted or deplyed. red means they are in the middle of attacking you, and purple means they are in the middle of attacking your wingmate (or squad memeber who is a player).</p>

<h3 class="head-font">Left HUD panel</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4qycHQXsAIIeRT.jpg:large">

<p class="stylep">if you press "1" on your keyboard or you press "Shift+A,"" it will bring you to the left panel, of your ship, that displays navigation info on one section, all transactions on the other, and reveals contacts, including nearby ships, stations, cargo canisters, and more.</p>

<p class="stylep">In the navigation tab, CMDR's will be presented with their current location, next hyperspace jump location (if route is plotted), and remaining jumps. On the left there are options for filtering the list of planets, stations, beacons, stars, signals, and more (top icon), underneath is the option for the galaxy map, and below it the system map. We will talk about both of these later. </p>

<p class="stylep">If you were to select one of the things on the list, it would bring you to a page where you are able to select that destination and fly towards it using your nav compass (with a solid circle being your target destination in front of you and hollow being behind you) while in supercruise, which is a common mode of transport that lets you travel faster than the speed of light to get around systems quickly, this is activated after hyperspace or if there is no target system to go to and the FSD is activated.</p>

<h3 class="head-font">Right HUD Panel</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://thecakeisaliegaming.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rebuy-cost-b33.jpg">

<p class="stylep"> if you press "4" on your keyboard or "Shift+D," it will bring you to your ship's right panel,
which shows your stats, ship modules, fire groups, ship cargo, and ship functions. This is the panel where you can see how many Credits you currently have, what your ranks and reputation are, prioritize your modules, use some ship functions such as night vision, lights, and self-destruct, and check out what you have in your cargo hold. This panel is mainly going to be a reference towards your progress though, as well as occasionally checking out you and your ships status' (jump range, armour, shields etc).</p>

<h3 class="head-font">Bottom Panel</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://thecakeisaliegaming.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/srv-deploy.jpg">

<p class="stylep">If you click "3" or "Shift+S" on your keyboard, it will take you to the lower panel of your ship located just above your character's knees. This is where you find information on/gain access to your ship-launched fighters, Surface Recon Vehicle, (SRV) and NPC crew members that you have on board.</p>

<h3 class="head-font">Comms Panel</h3>

<img id="small" class="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/c3kW8Zr.png">

<p class="stylep">Again, if you click "2" or "Shift+W" on your keyboard it will take you to your ships' communications panel located at the top-left of the interface. This panel is used for messaging other CMDR's and squadron, viewing messages from mission givers, joining frends' wing through invites, joining multi-crew, and giving you a heads-up on a close pirates' intentions.</p>

<h1 class="head-font">Flight and its Fundamentals</h1>

<img class="center" src="https://thecakeisaliegaming.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/thrusters.jpg">

<h3 class="head-font">Thrust</h3>

<p class="stylep">So, I'm guessing now you want to get flying. It can be tricky at first, particularly if you have no flight/space simulator experince, since most of these games, especially Elite Dangerous, use real-time flight physics, you will even find it leagues more challenging with the flight assist off, which is why most, if not all players, fly with the default setting (on).</p>

<p class="stylep">Every ship in Elite Dangerous has 4 types of thrust. Forward, (main) Backwards, vertical, and lateral (as seen in the image above). each version of thrust has a maximum speed that can be reached, depending on how many pips are in ENG and the amount of thruster engineering put into it (this will be covered later). In addition, most ships have different levels of manouverability, with the least being for large-size ships, and the most with small-size ships. speed is also directly proportional to the amount of manouverability a ship has.</p>

<p class="stylep">Make sure to also keep in mind that some ships with not-so-great thrusters will drift significantly more than others. It is space after all, and in space, there is nearly zero friction to keep your ship stable, so keep your flight assist on and metal to the throttle CMDR!</p>

<h1 class="head-font">Getting Around</h1>

<h3 class="head-font">The Galaxy Map</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/45I7fipXyKI/maxresdefault.jpg">

<p class="stylep">Journeys are planned through the galaxy map, but you can also select nearby systems quickly via the bottom of the navigation tab. The galaxy map allows you to plot multi-jump routes of up to 20,000LY. Remember to select between economical and fastest route computation via the route tab. It’s far more fuel efficient to perform multiple short jumps than a single long-distance jump, but doing so will dramatically increase journey time.</p>

<p class="stylep">When plotting a route, a solid line indicates that you have enough fuel to make the jump, whereas a dashed line means you have insufficient fuel (see image below). If you have a fuel scoop, the plotted route will also indicate the last scoopable star.</p>

<img class="center" src="https://thecakeisaliegaming.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/galaxy-map-route-plotting.jpg">

<h3 class="head-font">The System Map</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/7tidxjA.jpeg">

<p class="stylep">While travelling between star systems in hyperspace requires an already plotted route, travelling *through* star systems while in supercruise uses the system map, but you are free to fly wherever, (it's like normal flight, except faster than lightspeed)and if you are looking to head to a station or body or a star in a system, you would simply target it using the navigation tab in the ship's left panel, or target it using the system map (see image above).</p>

<h1 class="head-font">Ships And Modules</h1>

<h3 class="head-font">The Ships</h3>

<p class="stylep">Ships are undoubtedly, the central feature for all of Elite Dangerous. They are used to traverse the massive galaxy while undergoing a wide variety of tasks that make a Commander succesful. some ships may specialize in certain areas of combat, trade, and exploration while others might just be all-rounders,but the important thing to keep in mind that buying a new ship can cost you millions of credits, so don't rush into it, your current ship still works for what you chose it for.</p>

<p class="stylep">there is a total of 38 flyable ships in Elite Dangerous, here is a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkjWl4nkzCE">size comparison</a> in case you are interested.

<h3 class="head-font">Outfitting</h3>

<img class="center" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ag9g3ZOG188/maxresdefault.jpg">

<p class="stylep">Outfitting (always accessible at starports) is the single most important thing you can possible do once you purchase a new ship. It allows pilots to buy, sell, store, install, remove, and swap different weapon and equipment modules for their ship, which can improve its overall performance in different areas. With outfitting, you can take a fairly bad ship, and install modules that can make it 5x better. If a station has Outfitting available, it always also has Livery customisation as well.</p>

<div class="toc_container">
<p class="stylep">Note: When outfitting for more power/heat-intensive tasks, look towards the bottom for the two lines labelled "retracted" and "deployed" (see image above). If either goes over the megawatt limit of your ship's power plant (changeable in "core internal") then you require some power management. which means taking some power/heat-intensive modules out or replacing them with less intensive ones.</p>
